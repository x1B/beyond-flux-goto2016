<div class="slide-comment">
- Well, what are the defining aspect of Flux?
- Opinions vary:
  - Flux is about unidirectional flow
  - Flux is using View, Dispatcher, Action Creators and Store

- How important is this distinction?
  - Unidirectional data flow with changes expressed as immutable objects seems to be a good thing,
    let's not worry too much about labels.
