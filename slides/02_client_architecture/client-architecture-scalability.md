- scalability in frontend development:
  - focus on scalable productivity
  - parallel development of isolated components
  - fool-proof integration step
- layers of parallelism
  - multiple areas of business, use cases (-> services)
  - multiple teams
  - multiple technology backgrounds (within or across teams): polyglott development
  - multiple "geological" layers of legacy software that must be supported

- NEXT: what could be the basis of a reactive, scalable architecture
</div>

Note:

- nicht Last, sondern Komplexit√§t
- Isolation von Komponenten
- Parallele Entwicklung (mehrere Teams, Technologien, APIs)
