#### platform complexity
#### driving
#### application complexity




<div class="slide-comment">
- the web application platform is becoming ever more powerful
- more HTML5 APIs / CSS3 features / EcmaScript power
- static pages, fully client-generated markup, and everything in between
- great power: great responsibility

- Not discussing (but acknowledging) that "the web platform" is ill-defined, heterogeneous, fuzzy
- Not discussing if "big" web applications are good/bad -- they are being built
- Not discussing if SPAs are "bad" -- they are being built
- Here: think about how building these things can be less painful

- NEXT: besides "just" managing complexity, what do we want from architecture
</div>

Note:
- Powerful platform (HTML5, CSS3, ES2015)
- High complexity
- lets acknowledge that SPAs exist
