<div class="slide-comment">
- Welcome, I'm Michael and I'd like to talk to you about scalable frontend architecture.

- As starting point, I choose the Flux architecture, because I think it does several important things right,
  and has kindled a lot of interest in client architecture.

- From there, I'd like to have a look at what could be improved, and talk about possible ways to achieve this, including Redux and, more prominently in this talk, publish/subscribe.

Note:

- Welcome
- scalable frontend architecture
- starting point: flux
- then publish/subscribe
