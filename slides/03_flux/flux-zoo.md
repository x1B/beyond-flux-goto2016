![Der Flux-Zoo](slides/03_flux/images/zoo/zoo.png)


<div class="slide-comment">
 - Because Flux is just a *recipe* (an architectural pattern), there is not
   just one implementation.
 - In principle, you could just *write your own dispatcher* along with a couple
   of helper functions or abstract base classes to build your own flux system.
 - ...this is exactly what *a lot* of people did!

 - Because implementations are not interoperable, the result is a zoo rather
   than an ecosystem...
 - Prominent specimen: the *"Vanilla"-Flux by Facebook*, *Fluxible* by
   Yahoo, and *Alt.js* (Josh Perez, AirBnB).
 - Missing *Redux*? Well, some wouldn't even call that Flux, but rest assured,
   we'll talk about Redux, too.

 NEXT: ok, enough theory, let's have a look at an example...
